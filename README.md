## Project Overview

This project analyzes Chicago traffic crash data to explore how driver characteristics and vehicle conditions influence crash severity. The goal is to identify patterns that can inform safety policies and interventions to reduce high-severity crashes:

1. How do driver characteristics (e.g., age, sex, use of safety equipment) correlate with injury severity in crashes?

2. What are the most common vehicle types and conditions associated with high-severity crashes?

## Data Sources

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- **Traffic Crashes - People**: Contains details of individuals involved in a traffic crash, including injuries and fatalities, categorized by various factors such as age, injury type, and safety equipment usage.

- **Traffic Crashes - Vehicles**: Includes information on vehicles involved in crashes, covering vehicle make, model, defect, and travel direction. It helps in linking vehicle data with person and crash information.
